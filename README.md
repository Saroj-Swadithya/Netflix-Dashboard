## PROJECT NAME: 
Netflix Data Analysis Using Tableau 

# Total Movies & TV Shows by Year:

I created an impressive Netflix dashboard in Tableau using a dataset that contains over 6k rows of data and 12 different fields related to TV shows and movies. The first sheet is demonstrated how to visualize the count of TV shows and movies by year. 
In the "Total Movies & TV Shows by Year" analysis, the graph demonstrates a prominent peak for movies compared to TV shows. Notably, movies reached their highest point in 2019, while TV shows also experienced a significant peak during the same year, albeit with a relatively lower count.
